Practical - Encapsulation
In this example, you are asked to create a Car class.

Car class features -> Brand, Model, Color, Number of Doors

We want to encapsulate the number of doors from our properties.

If we want to assign a value other than 2 or 4 for the Number of Doors when a Car object is created, let's publish a warning message on the console screen and assign the Number of Doors value to -1.
